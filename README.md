Contao Simple News URLs
=======================

Simple Contao extension to allow news URLs without its reader page fragment. Instead of having an URL like

```
example.org/reader-page/news-entry.html
```

all news entries will instead be reachable via their alias directly, e.g.

```
example.org/news-entry.html
```
